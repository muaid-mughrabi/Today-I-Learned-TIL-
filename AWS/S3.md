# AWS S3
- S3 is an AWS service that provides a way to store data in the cloud üóÑÔ∏è.
- Buckets are like repositories, there you can store your files.
- After assuming your role (AWS equivalence to sign in using this role), you can use the web interface or the AWS CLI tool to upload/download objects, or modify the bucket.
- `aws s3 cp s3://BUCKET_NAME/PATH LOCAL/PATH` can be used to download files from a bucket, a similar logic can be used to upload files or copy content between buckets.
- Notice that to copy a folder you need to use the `--recursive` flag (unlike unix command where `-r` is sufficient).
- You can setup policies to control who is allowed to upload/download/modify which objects, you can also choose to keep older versions of your files.
- Automating s3 calls is very simple using python's [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html) client.
